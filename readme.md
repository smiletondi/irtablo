## Lessons Learned

This is my first Hacktoberfest challenge and i learned a lot.
These technologies are very interesting and i'm excited to use them in more projects.

1. [CLoudflare Workers](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/)
1. [Workers KV](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/kv)
1. [Cloudflare tunnels](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps)
1. [Miniflare](https://miniflare.dev/)

I wish i could built the server with [Durable Objects](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/runtime-apis/durable-objects) (too lazy ).
It would be Epic. Feel free to create a ticket if you wanna work on that.
